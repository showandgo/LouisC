    "text": "I am currently working in the Oleson Lab in University of Hawaii (Manoa) as I pursue my PhD. I work on the Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) project in the lab, which applies national accounting methods1 (used to compile metrics such as GDP) to systematically assess coastal ecosystems‚Äô contribution to the Hawaiian economy and engage with decision makers to catalyze transformative change in conservation and economic policy.\nHawaiian coastal waters are uniquely impacted by climate change, land use, and resource harvest levels that threaten coastal functioning. Hawai ªi‚Äôs reliance on its coasts for wellbeing and revenue, its blend of worldviews, and the centrality of environmental stewardship in Hawaiian culture, make the state a uniquely powerful place to demonstrate and refine the science of coastal natural capital accounting. Moreover, engagement with the state using accounts to inform coastal policy can serve as an example for Pacific island neighbours.\nAn ecosystem account begins with synthesising information about the extent, condition, and use of the natural environment of the landscape and seascape, focusing on locally relevant biophysical metrics of natural capital assets and ecosystem service flows. The process is designed to provide an evidence base for understanding and mapping natural capital, evaluating its status and trends, and exploring its relationship with priority economic sectors and livelihoods.\nBuilding the accounts involves compiling time series data for land and coastal habitats. We rely on remotely sensed products for terrestrial layers, and a state-wide data collaborative for marine benthic layers. Second, we synthesize existing data for relevant conditions such as fish stocks, coral cover, and water quality. Third, we quantify use with a focus on fisheries, recreation, tourism, and shoreline protection, using a combination of ecosystem service models, surveys, and secondary data. When feasible and appropriate, we are valuing and monetizing these ecosystem services using both standard non-market valuation techniques."

The research unravels just how much we undervalue Natural Capital using existing tools borrowed from finance, and proposes new empirical tools to redress that. It also proposes a novel way to better estimate Cultural Ecosystem Services through time payment vehicles instead of money.\nSeparately, I will also be assisting in an oral presentation titled, ‚ÄúCoastal Ecosystem Accounting for Hawai‚Äôi‚Äù at the same conference. The research is led by my PI (Dr Kirsten Oleson) and is one of the key projects in Oleson Lab.\nThe presentations will be in Session 37 and 21 respectively (conference program).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 2023\n\n\n\nCollege of Tropical Agriculture & Human Resources (CTAHR) Showcase & Research Symposium 2023, Oral Presentation Merit Award (doctoral)- ‚ÄúValuing Ecosystem Services as Non-Market, Non-Substitutable Goods‚Äù"
