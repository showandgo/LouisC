    "text": "I am currently working in the Oleson Lab in University of Hawaii (Manoa) as I pursue my PhD. I work on the Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) project in the lab, which applies national accounting methods1 (used to compile metrics such as GDP) to systematically assess coastal ecosystems’ contribution to the Hawaiian economy and engage with decision makers to catalyze transformative change in conservation and economic policy.\nHawaiian coastal waters are uniquely impacted by climate change, land use, and resource harvest levels that threaten coastal functioning. Hawaiʻi’s reliance on its coasts for wellbeing and revenue, its blend of worldviews, and the centrality of environmental stewardship in Hawaiian culture, make the state a uniquely powerful place to demonstrate and refine the science of coastal natural capital accounting. Moreover, engagement with the state using accounts to inform coastal policy can serve as an example for Pacific island neighbours.\nAn ecosystem account begins with synthesising information about the extent, condition, and use of the natural environment of the landscape and seascape, focusing on locally relevant biophysical metrics of natural capital assets and ecosystem service flows. The process is designed to provide an evidence base for understanding and mapping natural capital, evaluating its status and trends, and exploring its relationship with priority economic sectors and livelihoods.\nBuilding the accounts involves compiling time series data for land and coastal habitats. We rely on remotely sensed products for terrestrial layers, and a state-wide data collaborative for marine benthic layers. Second, we synthesize existing data for relevant conditions such as fish stocks, coral cover, and water quality. Third, we quantify use with a focus on fisheries, recreation, tourism, and shoreline protection, using a combination of ecosystem service models, surveys, and secondary data. When feasible and appropriate, we are valuing and monetizing these ecosystem services using non-market valuation techniques."

    "text": "Recent Highlights\n\n\n\nApr 2024\nWrapped up two presentations- of what will likely be the first chapter of my dissertation- at the 48th Annual Albert L. Tester Memorial Symposium, as well as the annual CTAHR Showcase & Research Symposium this past week, and cannot wait to present at the American Association of Geographers (AAG) 2024 Annual Meeting this week!\n\n🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿\nDec 2023\nWrapped up a busy end of the year with two wonderful updates.\nI presented along with my Principal Investigator (PI), Dr Kirsten Oleson, at the annual Hawaii SeaGrant Research Symposium our SeaGrant funded research on Using natural capital accounting to embed climate impacts into routine decision-making. I went through the basics of UN SEEA EA framework for ecosystem accounting, while going through some of our exciting preliminary results and possible policy applications!\n\nSuper proud that it went really well and actually elicited some genuine interest, gauging from the response, I do think we need to double up on our educational/ communication efforts, just so people have the necessary understanding to truly grapple with how our economic lives are conducted and especially in relation to the environment.\nHere are some of the (big picture) highlights in case you missed it!\n\nAttended the wonderful Piʻo summit on Dec 13, and I definitely left seeing the Piʻo (rainbow of hope in the storm)!\nInterdisciplinary research (or indeed interdisciplinary anything) is HARD, primarily because Science is not designed to see the WHOLE.\nI think humans have a fundamental need to want to stick to tribes and silos, and have a desire to create a whole new thing instead of go through the arduous effort of fixing something deeply broken. And because of those drives, we end up with a thousand new revolutionary frameworks claiming to be the new panacea.\nThis Circular Economy (CE) Piʻo Summit is certainly not that. But it is also telling for who was not in attendance or werenʻt invited. I left more energised to want to do the hard work and see the Piʻo amidst all the pain and hardness around.\nMay you find strength this holiday season and beyond to truly kākoʻo, even when the struggle gets real.\n🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿\nNov 2023\nI will yet again be talking about our Ecosystem Accounting work, hopefully this will be as informative and fun as last years.\nI am experimenting with a very non-conventional approach to this talk, so it is definitely one to catch, no prior knowledge or accounting/ economics experience required!\n\nRegister here for the Zoom info!\n\nItʻs a wrap! Now for an awkward photo. Mahalo to those who turned up, or tuned in online!\nJun 2023 (cont’d)\nCome check out the 30th (anniversary) Hawai’i Conservation Conference happening from June 26-29! I will be presenting a poster for our lab project “Coastal Ecosystem Accounting for Hawai’i” on June 28 from 5:30-7:30pm. Let me know if you are keen to learn more! \nJun 2023\nI will be delivering an oral presentation on my preliminary research titled, “Cultural Ecosystem Services and Discounting” at the 6th International Ecosummit, in Gold Coast, Australia from 13-17 June 2023. The research unravels just how much we undervalue Natural Capital using existing tools borrowed from finance, and proposes new empirical tools to redress that. It also proposes a novel way to better estimate Cultural Ecosystem Services through time payment vehicles instead of money.\nSeparately, I will also be assisting in an oral presentation titled, “Coastal Ecosystem Accounting for Hawai’i” at the same conference. This research is part of the larger NCA project led by my PI (Dr Kirsten Oleson) in the Oleson Lab.\nFor those in attendance, our presentations will be in Session 37 and 21 respectively (conference program)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 2023\n\n\n\nCollege of Tropical Agriculture & Human Resources (CTAHR) Showcase & Research Symposium 2023, Oral Presentation Merit Award (doctoral)- “Valuing Ecosystem Services as Non-Market, Non-Substitutable Goods”"
