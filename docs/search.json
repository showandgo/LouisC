    "text": "Heʻeia (PC: Aimee Sato)\nInternational frameworks such as the UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (Ecosystem Accounts) (SEEA EA) and IUCN GET 2.0 set out a roadmap for globally consistent and comparable ecosystem accounting standards which offer a reliable way to assess changes in ecosystem “health”. Set against these international standards, there is currently uneven compliance and buy-in across the world, while research and large data gaps remain. My research advocates for natural capital accounting and ecosystem accounting in Hawaiʻi, by laying the foundational pilot accounts across all moku (districts) in the Main Hawaiian Islands.\nThe precipitous decline of native ecosystems in Hawaiʻi generates a strong need for conservation, however funding for such conservation work have not kept pace with this need. Ecosystem accounts for Hawaiʻi if done well, can catalyze awareness, change, and redirect needed financial resources to address conservation priorities and needs."

    "text": "Recent Highlights\nOct 2024\nBeen keeping busy presenting the ecosystem accounts at a number of big conferences here in Honolulu, O’ahu! American Association of Geographers (AAG) Annual Conference (Apr 17), Hawaiʻi Conservation Conference (HCC) (Jul 31; poster session), and American Fisheries Society (AFS) Annual Conference presentation (Sep 23). Learnt heaps from scientists from a vast array of fields-geographers, restoration and cultural practitioners, fisheries biologists- and even got the chance to interact with folks working on fantastic research projects at He’eia NERR.\n\n\nOn that note, I will say deepening relationships and friendships at He’eia NERR have been incredibly rewarding, despite the significant personal expense. It is the right thing and the pono thing to do.\nMy dissertation has been taking shape nicely this couple of months too, with a number of personal breakthroughs, so am excited to share that soon, so watch this space!\nI’ve settled on a wonderful Hawaiian saying for my research-\nUlu a'e ke welina a ke aloha\n(Loving is the practice of an awake mind)\nI think this applies perfectly not just to how we collect and track data about humans and ecosystems, but how it affects the way we truly see and treasure things. And of course in it is a lesson for life too.\nApr 2024\nWrapped up two presentations- of what will likely be the first chapter of my dissertation- at the 48th Annual Albert L. Tester Memorial Symposium, as well as the annual CTAHR Showcase & Research Symposium this past week, and cannot wait to present at the American Association of Geographers (AAG) 2024 Annual Meeting this week!\n\n🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿\nDec 2023\nWrapped up a busy end of the year with two wonderful updates.\nI presented along with my Principal Investigator (PI), Dr Kirsten Oleson, at the annual Hawaii SeaGrant Research Symposium our SeaGrant funded research on Using natural capital accounting to embed climate impacts into routine decision-making. I went through the basics of UN SEEA EA framework for ecosystem accounting, while going through some of our exciting preliminary results and possible policy applications!\n\nSuper proud that it went really well and actually elicited some genuine interest, gauging from the response, I do think we need to double up on our educational/ communication efforts, just so people have the necessary understanding to truly grapple with how our economic lives are conducted and especially in relation to the environment.\nHere are some of the (big picture) highlights in case you missed it!\n\nAttended the wonderful Piʻo summit on Dec 13, and I definitely left seeing the Piʻo (rainbow of hope in the storm)!\nInterdisciplinary research (or indeed interdisciplinary anything) is HARD, primarily because Science is not designed to see the WHOLE.\nI think humans have a fundamental need to want to stick to tribes and silos, and have a desire to create a whole new thing instead of go through the arduous effort of fixing something deeply broken. And because of those drives, we end up with a thousand new revolutionary frameworks claiming to be the new panacea.\nThis Circular Economy (CE) Piʻo Summit is certainly not that. But it is also telling for who was not in attendance or werenʻt invited. I left more energised to want to do the hard work and see the Piʻo amidst all the pain and hardness around.\nMay you find strength this holiday season and beyond to truly kākoʻo, even when the struggle gets real.\n🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿🎄🌿🌿🌿\nNov 2023\nI will yet again be talking about our Ecosystem Accounting work, hopefully this will be as informative and fun as last years.\nI am experimenting with a very non-conventional approach to this talk, so it is definitely one to catch, no prior knowledge or accounting/ economics experience required!\n\nRegister here for the Zoom info!\n\nItʻs a wrap! Now for an awkward photo. Mahalo to those who turned up, or tuned in online!\nJun 2023 (cont’d)\nCome check out the 30th (anniversary) Hawai’i Conservation Conference happening from June 26-29! I will be presenting a poster for our lab project “Coastal Ecosystem Accounting for Hawai’i” on June 28 from 5:30-7:30pm. Let me know if you are keen to learn more! \nJun 2023\nI will be delivering an oral presentation on my preliminary research titled, “Cultural Ecosystem Services and Discounting” at the 6th International Ecosummit, in Gold Coast, Australia from 13-17 June 2023. The research unravels just how much we undervalue Natural Capital using existing tools borrowed from finance, and proposes new empirical tools to redress that. It also proposes a novel way to better estimate Cultural Ecosystem Services through time payment vehicles instead of money.\nSeparately, I will also be assisting in an oral presentation titled, “Coastal Ecosystem Accounting for Hawai’i” at the same conference. This research is part of the larger NCA project led by my PI (Dr Kirsten Oleson) in the Oleson Lab.\nFor those in attendance, our presentations will be in Session 37 and 21 respectively (conference program)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 2023\n\n\n\nCollege of Tropical Agriculture & Human Resources (CTAHR) Showcase & Research Symposium 2023, Oral Presentation Merit Award (doctoral)- “Valuing Ecosystem Services as Non-Market, Non-Substitutable Goods”"

    "text": "Preliminary Findings\n\nExtent\nLike in many places in Oceania, data limitations constrained the ability of the ecosystem extent accounts to identify most of the IUCN Ecosystem Funtional Groups (EFG) present in the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), except for one EFG, T7.4 (Urban and industrial ecosystems) (Keith et al., 2020). However, best available data used in the pilot extent accounts broadly cover 12 out of 42 EFGs existing in the MHI according to the IUCN. Ecosystem types accounted for in our study include- Developed, Grass/ Shrub, Tree Cover, Cropland, Pasture, Freshwater Wetlands, Estuarine Wetlands, and Barren.\nSome highlights from 2013 and 2019 ecosystem extent accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditions\nSimilar data limitations constrained the ecosystem condition accounts, with four condition variables for terrestrial EFGs (Burnt Area, Rainfall, Temperature, NDVI), and 14 for nearshore marine EFGs (Sea Surface Temperature, Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Degree Heating Weeks, kd490, Chlorophyll-a, Coral Cover, Adult Coral Density, Coral Diversity, Juvenile Coral Density, Primary Consumers, Secondary Consumers, Planktivores, Piscivores, Total Disease Prevalence).\nSome highlights from ecosystem condition accounts for Tree Cover ecosystem type:\n\n\n\nApplications\nImagine if we were able to assess extinction risk for species across Hawaiʻi, and have them be readily incorporated into everyday policy decicions? In a brief example below, I utilise the LIFE score methodology (Eyres et al., 2024), data from my pilot ecosystem accounts, and IUCN Ecosystem Functional Group (EFG) information (Keith et al., 2020) to identify possible changes to dry forests and thickets (EFG T1.2) in the moku of Kona, Oʻahu.\nHistoric estimates, which we term “human-absent” extent, of dry forests are shown here to be fairly extensive in the moku, but most of it has been altered by human land-use:\n\nMaking use of remotely sensed imagery of forest cover in 2013 and 2019, as well as rainfall conditions for both years, we identify likely areas suitable for such dry forests (left 2013, right 2019):\n\nAlthough there has been large increases in potential habitat area for dry forests, there are two important details to consider. Firstly, its increase is encroaching into upland rainforests, and secondly much of that increase is beyond the “human-absent” range of the EFG. We only include expansion that falls within the “human-absent” range in the calculation of extinction risk.\nThe resulting score between 2013 and 2019 is a positive one (0.1), or a reduction in extinction risk for a species whose range (eg. Alaheʻe) is the entire extent of the dry forest. We also calculate the LIFE score for rainforest (EFG T1.1, Tropical/Subtropical lowland rainforests) in Kona, Oʻahu and the score is unsurprisingly a negative one (-0.03), or an increase in extinction risk for a species whose range is the entire extent of the rainforest. Because these scores are calculated such that they are normalised by their “human-absent” baseline, we can add them, which gives an overall score of 0.07. In which case, the overall impact is a positive one.\nSome important caveats to remember, we have not accounted for any detail on survey data to establish actual range of the species. The extent changes are purely a result of remotely sensed data on forests and data on rainfall. We also assume that all areas of habitat are uniform, which is not the case in reality."
