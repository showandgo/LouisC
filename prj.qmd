**Jun 2023**

I will be delivering an oral presentation on my preliminary research titled, "Cultural Ecosystem Services and Discounting" at the 6th International Ecosummit, in Gold Coast, Australia from *13-17 June 2023*. The research unravels just how much we undervalue Natural Capital using existing tools borrowed from finance, and proposes new empirical tools to redress that. It also proposes a novel way to better estimate Cultural Ecosystem Services through time payment vehicles instead of money.

Separately, I will also be assisting in an oral presentation titled, "Coastal Ecosystem Accounting for Hawai'i" at the same conference. The research is led by my PI (Dr Kirsten Oleson) and is one of the key projects in Oleson Lab.
